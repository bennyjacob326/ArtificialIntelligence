british museum:
average number of moves: 193264.15
average number of iterations: 1546113.2
min moves: 4176
max moves: 12290928
min iterations: 522
max iterations: 1536366

an iteration was every time the board was reset, while a move was every time a queen was put down.
Hence, the amount of moves is 8x the amount of iterations

dfs:
average number of moves: 113.0
average number of iterations: 982.0
min moves: 113
max moves: 113
min iterations: 982
max iterations: 982

An iteration followed the way that was predefined, while the amount of moves was how many times the queen was moved.

forward checking:
average number of moves 263.0
average number of iterations 97.0
min moves: 97
max moves: 97
min iterations: 263
max iterations: 263

my forward checking placed queens only where it was known that there's nothing interfering with it. If there were no
possible spots in the row, it backtracked. It also backtracked where, if based on the new placement, there was a later
row that wouldn't have a slot to put a queen down.
An iteration was where it moved to the next row to attempt to place a queen, while a move was each time a queen was
placed.

heuristic repair:
average number of moves 23.48
average number of iterations 23.48
min moves: 4
max moves: 81
min iterations: 4
max iterations: 81

my heuristic repair randomly picked a row and checked the amount of conflict there were in each possible spot,
and when there were zero total conflicts, the puzzle is solved
An iteration is each time it was attempted to lower the amount of conflicts, which is the same as the amount of moves
